* Still need to extend weewx database for storing lightning data.

* Would be nice to figure out a way to utilize the real-time lightning strike packets with weewx.

* Find out if this code can receive packets on Windows platforms.

2018-06-22:

* Should implement support for weewx's station configuration feature, with a dialog to build a basic sensor_map during the installation process.

2019-01-28:

* Need to add syslog alert and graceful exit on startup if sensor_map is null/missing.

2019-11-15:

* (DONE!) Need to test WF forum user vinceskahan's Python 3 patches against WeeWX 3.x on Python 2 and WeeWX 4.x on Python 3.

* (DONE!) Need to add support for new WeatherFlow Tempest all-in-one sensor currently on Kickstarter campaign, as soon as the API for any new packet types has been published.

2020-05-09:

* Need to automatically detect running Python version.  As of this driver v1.10, it is hard-coded for WeeWX 4.x and Python 3. (See the changelog for three lines to edit for running under Python 2.)
